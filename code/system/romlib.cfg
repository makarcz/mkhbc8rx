# File: 	romlib.cfg
# Purpose: 	CC65 configuration for mkhbcrom.lib.
# Author:	Marek Karcz 2018.
#
# Feb 21 2018:
#	Created.
#
# Feb 22 2018:
#   Removed fake memory segment ROM3.
#   Adjusted size of MOS and start / size of ROM1 and ROM2 accordingly and
#   for added functions in firmware.
#
# 2/23/2018
#   Adjusted ROM1/ROM2 sizes to get space for changes to romlib.
#
# 2/24/2018
#   Added IOn memory sections and LIBARG section for ROMLIB arguments area.
